## Introduction

This project is a Streamlit web application that demonstrates how to use [PyGWalker](https://github.com/your-username/pygwalker), a Python library for data visualization. With PyGWalker, you can easily create interactive and informative visualizations for your data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- PyGWalker

You can install Streamlit and PyGWalker using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pygwalker
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. Upload your CSV file to visualize data using PyGWalker in Streamlit.

5. Explore and interact with the visualizations generated by PyGWalker.

To include images, create an `images` folder in your project directory and place your images (e.g., `pygwalker-logo.png`, `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`) inside that folder. Then, reference these images in your README using the Markdown image syntax as shown in the example above.

Remember to replace placeholders like `your-username`, `your-repo-name`, and adjust the image filenames and paths to match your project. Additionally, you can customize the README further to provide more specific information about your project, such as installation instructions, usage examples, and additional sections relevant to your project's documentation.
